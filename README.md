# GBU-Dataset-Machine-learning-Project


This project is about calculating and working on the GBU data set with the DeeFace library (link: https://pypi.org/project/deepface/) 

we start with the models inside the library but the time needed was very big and the work was slow so we did a new way (thanks to dr lahouri mentioning it) 
and it is about calculating the embeddings for each photo then with vectors similarity we calculate the values. This way was much faster.

thanks very much to my partners 

1. Abd Al Aziz Tawila 
2. Firas Tatari 

thanks again to our Doctor and special thanks to my collage Nour Eldin Farahat 

NOTE: I put a new code to make the process much faster using the PyTorch library and GPU computing (GPU optimized code.py)
