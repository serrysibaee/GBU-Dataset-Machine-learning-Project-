# GBU-Dataset-Machine-learning-Project


This project is about calculating and working on the GBU data set with DeeFace library (link: https://pypi.org/project/deepface/) 

we start with the models inside the library but the time needed was very big and the work was slow so we did a new way (thank to our dr lahouri to mention it) 
and it is about calcalitng the embeddings for each photo then with vectors similarity we calculate the values. This way was much faster.

thanks very much for my partners
